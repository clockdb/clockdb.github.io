<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Veritec, Inc. (Veritec) was formed in the State
of Nevada on September 8, 1982. Veritec’s wholly owned subsidiaries include Veritec Financial Systems, Inc., Tangible Payment

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On January 12, 2009, Veritec formed Veritec
Financial Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, to bring its Mobile Banking Technology, products and related professional services
to market. In 2009 through 2016, the Company has had agreements with various banks, including Security First Bank (terminated in
October 2010), Palm Desert National Bank (which was later assigned to First California Bank and subsequently Pacific Western Bank
that terminated in June 2013), and Central Bank of Kansas City (“CBKC”). Late in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016,
the relationship between CBKC and the Company ended and the Company is currently seeking a bank to sponsor its Prepaid Card programs
(see below). As a Cardholder Independent Sales Organization, Veritec is able to promote and sell Visa branded card programs. As
a Third-Party Servicer, Veritec provides back-end cardholder transaction processing services for Visa branded card programs on
behalf of its sponsoring bank. The Company has a portfolio of five United States&nbsp;and eight foreign patents. In addition, we
have seven U.S.&nbsp;and twenty-eight foreign pending patent applications.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt/93% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated
in consolidation.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt/93% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt/93% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible
accounts, analysis of impairments of long lived assets, accruals for potential liabilities, assumptions made in valuing stock instruments
issued for services, and valuation of deferred tax assets.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt/93% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Company sells to domestic and foreign
companies and grants uncollateralized credit to customers, but requires deposits on unique orders. Management periodically reviews
its accounts receivable and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts after analyzing the age of the receivable, payment history
and prior experience with the customer. The estimated loss that management believes is probable is included in the allowance for
doubtful accounts.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt/93% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt/93% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">While the ultimate loss may differ, management
believes that any additional loss will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position. Due to uncertainties in
the settlement process, however, it is at least reasonably possible that management's estimate will change during the near term.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">During the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company
had one customer, a related party, that represented 53% of our revenues and one customer that represented 14% of our revenues.
No other customer represented more than 10% of our revenues.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">During the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company
had no foreign revenues. During the year ended June 30, 2016, foreign revenues accounted for 19% (6% Korea, 8% Taiwan and 5% others)
of the Company’s total revenues.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><u>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</u></p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Fair value measurements adopted by the Company
are based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) which defines
fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB authoritative
guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels
as follows:</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 45pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 6pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt">Level 1 - Quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 6pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt">Level 2 - Inputs,
other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 6pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt">Level 3 - Unobservable
inputs based on the Company's assumptions.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and current liabilities, including notes payable and convertible
notes, approximate their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their
expected realization and their current market rates of interest.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">At June 30, 2017, the Company’s Consolidated
Balance Sheet included the fair value of derivative liabilities of $728,000, which was based on Level 2 measurements. At June 30,
2016, the Company did not have derivative liabilities.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><u>Derivative Financial Instruments</u></p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Company evaluates its financial instruments
to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial
instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then
re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The classification
of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the
end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based
on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In the case of insufficient authorized share
capital available to fully settle outstanding contracts, the Company utilizes the earliest inception date sequencing method to
prioritize its convertible securities. At each reporting date, the Company reviews its convertible securities to determine their
classification is appropriate.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt/93% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><u>Revenue Recognition</u></p>

<p style="font: 10pt/93% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Company accounts for revenue recognition
in accordance with guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Revenues for the Company are classified into mobile banking
technology, management fee revenue, and barcode technology.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt/93% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 45pt; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt/93% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Company, as a merchant payment processor
and a distributor, recognizes revenue from transaction fees charged to cardholders for the use of its issued mobile debit cards.
The fees are recognized on a monthly basis after all cardholder transactions have been summarized and reconciled with third party
processors.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Prior to the year ended June 30, 2016, the
Company entered into certain long term agreements to provide application development and support. Some customers paid the agreement
in full at signing and the Company recorded the receipt of payment as deferred revenue. The Company records revenue relating to
these agreements on a pro-rata basis over the term of the agreement and reduces its deferred revenue balance accordingly.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 20pt"><u>b. Management Fee Revenue</u></p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On September 30, 2015, the Company sold all
of its assets of its Barcode Technology comprised solely of its intellectual property to The Matthews Group (see Note 9) and entered
into a management services agreement with The Matthews Group to manage all facets of the barcode technology operations, on behalf
of The Matthews Group, through July 31, 2018. The Company earns a fee of 20% of all revenues billed from the barcode technology
operations up to May 31, 2017 and 35% of all revenues billed up to July 31, 2018.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 20pt"><u>c. Barcode Technology Revenue</u></p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt/93% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Company’s Barcode Technology
was a product identification system for identification and tracking of parts, components and products mostly in the liquid crystal
display (LCD) markets and for secure identification documents, financial cards, medical records and other high security applications.
The Company recognized revenues from perpetual licenses and related identification cards when the product was shipped, the Company
no longer had any service or other continuing obligations, and collection was reasonably assured. The process typically began with
a customer purchase order detailing its specifications so the Company could import its software into the customer's hardware. Once
importation is completed, if the customer only wished to purchase a license, the Company typically transmitted the software to
the customer via the Internet. Revenue was recognized at that point. If the customer requested both license and hardware, once
the software was imported into the hardware and the process was complete, the product was shipped, and revenue was recognized at
time of shipment. Once the software and/or other products was either shipped or transmitted, the customers did not have a right
of refusal or return.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt/93% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On September 30, 2015, the Company and The
Matthews Group, a related party, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company sold the intellectual property
assets relating to its Barcode Technology. Barcode Technology revenue for the year ended June 30, 2016 represents the revenue earned
from July 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015, the date it was sold.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 45pt; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed
by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders
by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding plus the number of additional common stock that would have been outstanding
if all dilutive potential common stock had been issued, using the treasury stock method. Potential common stock are excluded from
the computation as their effect is antidilutive.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">For the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016,
the calculations of basic and diluted loss per share are the same because potential dilutive securities would have an anti-dilutive
effect.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Company periodically issues stock options
and warrants to employees and non-employees in capital raising transactions, for services and for financing costs. &nbsp;The Company
accounts for stock option and stock warrant grants to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The
Company accounts for stock option and stock warrant grants to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the
FASB where the value of the stock compensation is determined based upon the measurement date at either a) the date at which a performance
commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee
stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances
where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option or warrant grants are immediately vested and the
total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.</p>

in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB. Intangibles are valued at their fair market value and are amortized
taking into account the character of the acquired intangible asset and the expected period of benefit. The Company evaluates intangible
assets for impairment, at a minimum, on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable from its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Recoverability of intangible assets is measured
by comparing their net book value to the related projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets, considering a number of factors,
including past operating results, budgets, economic projections, market trends and product development cycles. If the net book
value of the asset exceeds the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset is considered impaired, and a second test is performed
to measure the amount of impairment loss.&nbsp;</p>

$16,042 relates to our acquisition of Tangible Payments LLC during fiscal year 2016 (see Note 3). Management believes there were
no indications of impairment based on management’s assessment of these assets at June 30, 2017. Factors we consider important
that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating
results, significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative
industry or economic trends. If current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues and increased costs, we may have
to record an impairment to our intangible assets.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Company accounts for income taxes using
the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax
liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0 45pt; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,&nbsp;<i>Revenue from Contracts with Customers</i>. ASU 2014-09
is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current
U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU 2014-09, revenue is recognized
when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which
the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard disclosure of the nature, amount,
timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08,
ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11, ASU 2016-12, and ASU 2016-20 all of which clarify certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09.
ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. The standard can be adopted either
retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect
of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). The
Company is currently in the process of analyzing the information necessary to determine the impact of adopting this new guidance
on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the
first quarter of fiscal 2018.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02,&nbsp;<i>Leases</i>. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability
on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required
for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest period presented
in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial
statements and related disclosures.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11<i>,
Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part
I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II) Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for
Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
with a Scope Exception</i>. ASU 2017-11 allows companies to exclude a down round feature when determining whether a financial instrument
(or embedded conversion feature) is considered indexed to the entity’s own stock. As a result, financial instruments (or
embedded conversion features) with down round features may no longer be required to be accounted for as derivative liabilities.
A company will recognize the value of a down round feature only when it is triggered and the strike price has been adjusted downward.
For equity-classified freestanding financial instruments, an entity will treat the value of the effect of the down round as a dividend
and a reduction of income available to common shareholders in computing basic earnings per share. For convertible instruments with
embedded conversion features containing down round provisions, entities will recognize the value of the down round as a beneficial
conversion discount to be amortized to earnings. The guidance in ASU 2017-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the guidance is to be applied using a
full or modified retrospective approach. The adoption of ASU 2017-11 is expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial statements and related disclosures because derivative liabilities from financial instruments (or embedded conversion
features) that have down round features will be reclassified from liabilities to additional paid-in capital, effective as of the
beginning of the fiscal year.</p>

by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities

financial statements.</p>
