Rights held by others to remove the party with power over the VIE are not considered unless one party can exercise those rights unilaterally. When changes occur to the design of an entity, we reconsider whether it is subject to the VIE model. We continuously evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in a VIE.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We hold a controlling financial interest in other entities where we currently hold, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where we exercise control through substantive participating rights or as a general partner. Where we are a general partner, we consider substantive removal rights held by other partners in determining if we hold a controlling financial interest. We reevaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in these entities when our voting or substantive participating rights change. </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">Associated companies are unconsolidated VIEs and other entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest, but over which we have significant influence, most often because we hold a voting interest of 20% to 50%. Associated companies are accounted for as equity method investments. Our share of the results of associated companies are presented on a one-line basis. Investments in, and advances to, associated companies are presented on a one-line basis in the caption “All other assets” in our Statement of Financial Position, net of allowance for losses, which represents our best estimate of probable losses inherent in such assets.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;color:#005cb9;">FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION</font></div><div style="line-height:110%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We have reclassified certain prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year’s presentation.

Although our current estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, as appropriate, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Among other effects, such changes could result in future impairments of investment securities, goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, revisions to estimated profitability on long-term product service agreements, incremental losses on financing receivables, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, incremental fair value marks on businesses and assets held for sale carried at lower of cost or market less cost to sell, increased tax liabilities and insurance reserves.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;color:#005cb9;">ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES</font></div><div style="line-height:110%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">SALES OF GOODS AND SERVICES</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We record all sales of goods and services only when a firm sales agreement is in place, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and collectability of the fixed or determinable sales price is reasonably assured.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">Arrangements for the sale of goods and services sometimes include multiple components. Most of our multiple component arrangements involve the sale of goods and services in the Healthcare segment. Our arrangements with multiple components usually involve an upfront deliverable of large machinery or equipment and future service deliverables such as installation, commissioning, training or the future delivery of ancillary products. In most cases, the relative values of the undelivered components are not significant to the overall arrangement and are typically delivered within </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">three</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> to </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">six months</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> after the core product has been delivered. In such agreements, selling price is determined for each component and any difference between the total of the separate selling prices and total contract consideration (i.e., discount) is allocated pro rata across each of the components in the arrangement. The value assigned to each component is objectively determined and obtained primarily from sources such as the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from competitor prices for similar items. If such evidence is not available, we use our best estimate of selling price, which is established consistent with the pricing strategy of the business and considers product configuration, geography, customer type, and other market specific factors. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">Except for goods sold under long-term agreements, we recognize sales of goods under the provisions of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;">Revenue Recognition</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">. In arrangements where we sell products that provide the customer with a right of return, we use our accumulated experience to estimate and provide for such returns when we record the sale. In situations where arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have reliably demonstrated that all specified acceptance criteria have been met or when formal acceptance occurs, respectively. In arrangements where we provide goods for trial and evaluation purposes, we only recognize revenue after customer acceptance occurs. Unless otherwise noted, we do not provide for anticipated losses before we record sales.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We recognize revenue on agreements for sales of goods and services under power generation unit and uprate contracts, nuclear fuel assemblies, larger oil drilling equipment projects, aeroderivative unit contracts, military development contracts, locomotive production contracts, and long-term construction projects, using long-term construction and production contract accounting. We estimate total long-term contract revenue net of price concessions as well as total contract costs. For goods sold under power generation unit and uprate contracts, nuclear fuel assemblies, aeroderivative unit contracts, military development contracts and locomotive production contracts, we recognize sales as we complete major contract-specified deliverables, most often when customers receive title to the goods or accept the services as performed. For larger oil drilling equipment projects and long-term construction projects, we recognize sales based on our progress toward contract completion measured by actual costs incurred in relation to our estimate of total expected costs. We measure long-term contract revenues by applying our contract-specific estimated margin rates to incurred costs. We routinely update our estimates of future costs for agreements in process and report any cumulative effects of such adjustments in current operations. We provide for any loss that we expect to incur on these agreements when that loss is probable. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We recognize revenue upon delivery for sales of aircraft engines and military propulsion equipment. Delivery of commercial aircraft engines and non-U.S. military equipment occurs on shipment; delivery of military propulsion equipment sold to the U.S. government or agencies thereof occurs upon receipt of a Material Inspection and Receiving Report, DD&nbsp;Form&nbsp;250 or Memorandum of Shipment. Commercial aircraft engines are complex equipment manufactured to customer order under a variety of sometimes complex, long-term agreements. We measure sales of commercial aircraft engines by applying our contract-specific estimated margin rates to incurred costs. We routinely update our estimates of future revenues and costs for commercial aircraft engine agreements in process and report any cumulative effects of such adjustments in current operations. Significant components of our revenue and cost estimates include price concessions and performance-related guarantees as well as material, labor and overhead costs. We measure revenue for military propulsion equipment and spare parts not subject to long-term product services agreements based on the specific contract on a specifically measured output basis. We provide for any loss that we expect to incur on these agreements when that loss is probable; consistent with industry practice, for commercial aircraft engines, we make such provision only if such losses are not recoverable from future highly probable sales of spare parts and services for those engines.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We sell product services under long-term product maintenance or extended warranty agreements in our Aviation, Power, Oil &amp; Gas and Transportation segments, where costs of performing services are incurred on other than a straight-line basis. We also sell similar long-term product services in our Healthcare and Renewable Energy segments, where such costs generally are expected to be incurred on a straight-line basis. For the Aviation, Power, Oil &amp; Gas and Transportation agreements, we recognize related sales based on the extent of our progress toward completion measured by actual costs incurred in relation to total expected costs. We routinely update our estimates of future costs for agreements in process and report any cumulative effects of such adjustments in current operations. For the Healthcare and Renewable Energy agreements, we recognize revenues on a straight-line basis and expense related costs as incurred. We provide for any loss that we expect to incur on any of these agreements when that loss is probable.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;padding-left:48px;text-indent:-48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">GE CAPITAL REVENUES FROM SERVICES (EARNED INCOME)</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;padding-left:48px;text-indent:-48px;font-size:8pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:8pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We use the interest method to recognize income on loans. Interest on loans includes origination, commitment and other non-refundable fees related to funding (recorded in earned income on the interest method). We stop accruing interest at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days past due. Previously recognized interest income that was accrued but not collected from the borrower is reversed, unless the terms of the loan agreement permit capitalization of accrued interest to the principal balance.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;"> </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">Payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to reduce the principal balance of the loan. </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We resume accruing interest on nonaccrual, non-restructured loans only when (a) payments are brought current according to the loan’s original terms and (b) future payments are reasonably assured. When we agree to restructured terms with the borrower, we resume accruing interest only when it is reasonably assured that we will recover full contractual payments, and such loans pass underwriting reviews equivalent to those applied to new loans. </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We recognize financing lease income on the interest method to produce a level yield on funds not yet recovered. Estimated unguaranteed residual values are based upon management's best estimates of the value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term. We use various sources of data in determining these estimates, including information obtained from third parties, which is adjusted for the attributes of the specific asset under lease. Guarantees of residual values by unrelated third parties are included within minimum lease payments. Significant assumptions we use in estimating residual values include estimated net cash flows over the remaining lease term, anticipated results of future remarketing, and estimated future component part and scrap metal prices, discounted at an appropriate rate.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We recognize operating lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of underlying leases.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">BUSINESSES AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">Businesses and assets held for sale represent components that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and liability amounts in our financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. Financing receivables that no longer qualify to be presented as held for investment must be classified as assets held for sale and recognized in our financial statements at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with that amount representing a new cost basis at the date of transfer.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">The determination of fair value for businesses and assets held for sale involves significant judgments and assumptions. Development of estimates of fair values in this circumstance is complex and is dependent upon, among other factors, the nature of the potential sales transaction (for example, asset sale versus sale of legal entity), composition of assets and/or businesses in the disposal group, the comparability of the disposal group to market transactions and negotiations with third party purchasers. Such factors bear directly on the range of potential fair values and the selection of the best estimates. Key assumptions were developed based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We review all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values, less cost to sell.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">The cost of GE manufacturing plant and equipment is generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated economic life. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">The cost of </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">GE Capital </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">equipment leased to others on operating leases is depreciated on a straight-line basis to estimated residual value over the lease term or over the estimated economic life of the equipment.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">Our financing receivables portfolio consists of a variety of loans and leases, including both larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans and leases and smaller-balance homogeneous loans and leases.

The method for calculating the best estimate of losses depends on the size, type and risk characteristics of the related financing receivable. Such an estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates, financial health of specific customers and market sectors, collateral values, and the present and expected future levels of interest rates. The underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions. Changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses. It is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates. Write-offs are deducted from the allowance for losses when we judge the principal to be uncollectible and subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance at the time cash is received on a written-off account. </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">PARTIAL SALES OF BUSINESS INTERESTS</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">Gains or losses on sales of affiliate shares where we retain a controlling financial interest are recorded in equity.

For debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security. We also evaluate quantitative criteria including determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. If we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, we consider the security to be other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI), and we record the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its recoverable amount in earnings and the difference between the security’s recoverable amount and fair value in other comprehensive income. If we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the security is also considered OTTI and we recognize the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value in earnings. For equity securities, we consider the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position.

The pricing vendor uses various pricing models for each asset class that are consistent with what other market participants would use. The inputs and assumptions to the model of the pricing vendor are derived from market observable sources including: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and other market-related data. Since many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the methodology of the pricing vendor uses available information as applicable such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. The pricing vendor considers available market observable inputs in determining the evaluation for a security. Thus, certain securities may not be priced using quoted prices, but rather determined from market observable information. These investments are included in Level 2 and primarily comprise our portfolio of corporate fixed income, and government, mortgage and asset-backed securities. In infrequent circumstances, our pricing vendors may provide us with valuations that are based on significant unobservable inputs, and in those circumstances we classify the investment securities in Level 3.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">Annually, we conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendor to validate that the inputs used in that vendor’s pricing process are deemed to be market observable as defined in the standard. While we are not provided access to proprietary models of the vendor, our reviews have included on-site walk-throughs of the pricing process, methodologies and control procedures for each asset class and level for which prices are provided. Our reviews also include an examination of the underlying inputs and assumptions for a sample of individual securities across asset classes, credit rating levels and various durations. In addition, the pricing vendor has an established challenge process in place for all security valuations, which facilitates identification and resolution of potentially erroneous prices. We believe that the prices received from our pricing vendor are representative of prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date (exit prices) and are classified appropriately in the hierarchy.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We use non-binding broker quotes and other third-party pricing services as our primary basis for valuation when there is limited, or no, relevant market activity for a specific instrument or for other instruments that share similar characteristics. We have not adjusted the prices we have obtained. Investment securities priced using non-binding broker quotes and other third-party pricing services are included in Level 3. As is the case with our primary pricing vendor, third-party brokers and other third-party pricing services do not provide access to their proprietary valuation models, inputs and assumptions. Accordingly, we conduct reviews of vendors, as applicable, similar to the reviews performed of our primary pricing vendor. In addition, we conduct internal reviews of pricing for all such investment securities quarterly to ensure reasonableness of valuations used in our financial statements. These reviews are designed to identify prices that appear stale, those that have changed significantly from prior valuations, and other anomalies that may indicate that a price may not be accurate. Based on the information available, we believe that the fair values provided by the brokers and other third-party pricing services are representative of prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date (exit prices).</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">Derivatives.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> We use closing prices for derivatives included in Level 1, which are traded either on exchanges or liquid over-the-counter markets.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">The majority of our derivatives are valued using internal models. The models maximize the use of market observable inputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency and commodity forward and option contracts.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 3 primarily represent equity derivatives and interest rate products that contain embedded optionality or prepayment features.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. These assets can include loans and long-lived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale, impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, cost and equity method investments and long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired and the remeasurement of retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in deconsolidation of a subsidiary, if we sell a controlling interest and retain a noncontrolling stake in the entity. Assets that are written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">The following sections describe the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and for certain assets within our pension plans and retiree benefit plans at each reporting period, as applicable.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">Financing Receivables and Loans Held for Sale.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> When available, we use observable market data, including pricing on recent closed market transactions, to value loans that are included in Level 2. When this data is unobservable, we use valuation methodologies using current market interest rate data adjusted for inherent credit risk, and such loans are included in Level 3. When appropriate, loans may be valued using collateral values (see Long-lived Assets below).</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">Cost and Equity Method Investments.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> Cost and equity method investments are valued using market observable data such as quoted prices when available. When market observable data is unavailable, investments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, comparative market multiples or a combination of both approaches as appropriate and other third-party pricing sources. These investments are generally included in Level 3.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">Investments in private equity, real estate and collective funds held within our pension plans, are generally valued using the net asset value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient for fair value provided certain criteria are met. The NAVs are determined based on the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds. On January 1, 2016, we adopted guidance whereby investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV practical expedient are no longer classified in the fair value hierarchy.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">Long-lived Assets</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">. Fair values of long-lived assets, including aircraft, are primarily derived internally and are based on observed sales transactions for similar assets. In other instances, for example, collateral types for which we do not have comparable observed sales transaction data, collateral values are developed internally and corroborated by external appraisal information. Adjustments to third-party valuations may be performed in circumstances where market comparables are not specific to the attributes of the specific collateral or appraisal information may not be reflective of current market conditions due to the passage of time and the occurrence of market events since receipt of the information.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">Retained Investments in Formerly Consolidated Subsidiaries.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> Upon a change in control that results in deconsolidation of a subsidiary, the fair value measurement of our retained noncontrolling stake is valued using market observable data such as quoted prices when available, or if not available, an income approach, a market approach, or a combination of both approaches as appropriate. In applying these methodologies, we rely on a number of factors, including actual operating results, future business plans, economic projections, market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, and possible control premium. These investments are generally included in Level 1 or Level 3, as appropriate, determined at the time of the transaction.</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;color:#005cb9;">ACCOUNTING CHANGES</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">On January 1, 2018, we will adopt Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;">Revenue from Contracts with Customers</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">, and the related amendments, which will supersede most existing U.S. GAAP revenue guidance.

Upon adoption, we will record a </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">$4.2 billion</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"> non-cash charge to our January 1, 2016 retained earnings to reflect the change in timing in the recognition of revenue and certain costs primarily within our Power and Aviation businesses.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;">The new ASU also requires incremental disclosures, including the amount of revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations for existing customer contracts. While the remaining performance obligation disclosure is similar, in concept, to our reported backlog, the new ASU definition excludes revenue from contracts that provide the customer with the right to cancel or terminate for convenience, even if our historical experience indicates the likelihood of cancellation or termination is remote.&nbsp;As a result, we anticipate the remaining performance obligation disclosure will be significantly lower than our historically reported backlog.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">On September 30, 2016, we adopted ASU 2016-09, </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;">Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">, which was intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">We adopted the standard on a prospective basis with the effect of adoption reflected for the interim periods after the year beginning January 1, 2016 as required by the standard. The primary effects of adoption were the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital and the reclassification of cash flows related to excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities for the periods beginning January 1, 2016. We will continue to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest in our determination of the related periodic compensation cost.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">As a result of the adoption, our provision for income taxes decreased by </font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;">$97 million</font><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;"> for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, for the excess tax benefits related to share-based payments in its provision for income taxes.
