As of December&nbsp;31, 2020, we owned and operated 320 Medicare-certified home health care centers, 180 Medicare-certified hospice care centers and 14 personal-care care centers in 39 states within the United States and the District of Columbia.</span></div><div style="margin-top:14pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements</span></div><div style="margin-top:5pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">, which provides guidance for measuring credit losses on financial instruments. Our adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. </span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2019-12, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">, which eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating taxes during the interim periods and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes, enacts changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Our adoption of this standard on a prospective basis was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 842,</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> Leases, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">using a modified retrospective transition approach, which requires the new standard to be applied to all leases existing at the date of initial application. Under ASC 842, lessees are required to recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset ("ROU asset") for all leases with a term greater than twelve months and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Additionally, leases are classified as either financing or operating; the classification determines the pattern of expense recognition and classification within the statement of operations. We used the standard's effective date as our date of initial application. Consequently, our financial information was not updated and the disclosures required under the new standard are not provided for dates and periods prior to January 1, 2019. The new standard provides several optional practical expedients that can be adopted at transition. We elected the "package of practical expedients," which allows us to not reassess our prior conclusions regarding lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We did not elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to us. The most significant effects related to this adoption relate to (1) the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our real estate and fleet operating leases; and (2) significant new disclosures about our leasing activities. Upon adoption, we recognized approximately $80 million in operating leases liabilities with corresponding ROU assets of approximately the same amount. The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. We have elected the practical expedient that allows us to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases. </span></div><div style="margin-top:5pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2018-07,</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployees Share-Based Payment Accounting, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payments issued to nonemployees for goods or services. Our adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.</span></div><div style="margin-top:5pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Revenue from Contracts with Customers, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">using the full retrospective method. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The standard supersedes existing revenue recognition requirements and eliminates most industry-specific guidance from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP"). The core principle of the revenue recognition standard is to require an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. As a result of the Company's adoption of ASC 606, the revenue and related estimated uncollectible amounts owed to us by non-Medicare payors that were historically classified as provision for doubtful accounts are now considered a revenue adjustment in determining net service revenue. Accordingly, the Company reports estimated uncollectible balances due from third-party payors and uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction of the transaction price and therefore, as a reduction in net service revenue (or as it relates to Hospice room and board, an increase in cost of service, excluding depreciation and amortization) when historically these amounts were classified as provision for doubtful accounts within operating expenses within our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the adoption of ASC 606 resulted in increased disclosure, </span></div><div style="margin-top:5pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  </span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2017-01, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">, which provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as an acquisition (or disposal) of assets or a business. We adopted this ASU on a prospective basis. The impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures will depend on the facts and circumstances of any specific future transactions as evaluated under the new framework.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span><br></span></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2017-04, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge (Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test). Instead, impairment will be measured using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this ASU on a prospective basis and will apply this guidance to our future tests of goodwill impairment.</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-15, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">, which provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues not specifically addressed by U.S. GAAP. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017. The standard should be applied using a retrospective transition method unless it is impractical to do so for some of the issues. In such case, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Our adoption of this standard using a retrospective transition method for each period presented did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.</span></div><div style="margin-top:14pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</span></div><div style="margin-top:5pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">On March 12, 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued, subject to meeting certain criteria. The amendments in this ASU were effective beginning on March 12, 2020 and may generally be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. This standard will not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. </span></div><div style="margin-top:14pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Use of Estimates</span></div><div style="margin-top:5pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. GAAP.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in our accompanying consolidated financial statements, and business combinations accounted for as purchases have been included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.

Third party equity interests in our consolidated joint ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements. During 2016, we sold a 30% interest in one of our care centers while maintaining a controlling interest in the newly formed joint venture; we repurchased the 30% interest during 2018.</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We account for investments in entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50% or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a variable interest entity in which we are the primary beneficiary.

The Company's original investment was made in 2010 and no longer fit within our strategic areas of focus. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay down debt and fund operations. During 2018, we made a $7.0 million investment in a healthcare analytics company; this investment is accounted for under the equity method. The book value of investments that we account for under the equity method of accounting totaled $14.2 million and $35.7 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is reflected in other assets within our consolidated balance sheets.<span></span>
