concept but operating expenses such as rent, overhead and management salaries and other corporate expense are not allocated among
the franchise concepts and net income is measured at the Company wide level to allocate resources and assess the Company’s
overall performance. The Company shares common, centralized support functions, including finance, human resources, legal, information
technology, and corporate marketing, all of which report directly to the COO. Accordingly, decision-making regarding the Company’s
overall operating performance and allocation of Company resources is assessed on a consolidated basis. As such,&nbsp;the Company

preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates

estimates and assumptions made by management include allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for deferred tax assets, depreciation
of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, recoverability of long lived assets and fair market value of equity
instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates as the current economic environment has increased the degree of
uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.</font></p>

Company reviews accounts and notes receivable periodically for collectability and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts
and records bad debt expense when deemed necessary. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts and notes that is based
on historical trends, customer knowledge, any known disputes, and considers the aging of the accounts receivable balances combined
with management’s estimate of future potential recoverability. Receivables and notes are written off against the allowance
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed. The Company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts at September
30, 2017 and 2016 are adequate, but actual write-offs could exceed the recorded allowance. During the years ended September 30,
2017 and September 30, 2016, the values of accounts written-off to the reserve were approximately $125,000 and $89,000, respectively.</font></p>

Company’s long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, and intangible assets. The Company tests for impairment losses
on long-lived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset
may not be recoverable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying
amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.&nbsp;&nbsp;If such asset is considered
to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
fair value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Impairment evaluations involve management’s estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual
useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management which could have a material effect on our reporting
results and financial positions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted
cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there
can be no assurances that demand for the Company’s products or services will continue, which could result in an impairment
of long-lived assets in the future.</font></p>

a periodic basis, the Company assesses the probability that its net deferred tax assets, if any, will be recovered. If after evaluating

May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09 “Revenue with
Contracts from Customers (Topic 606).” ASU 2014-09 supersedes the current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific
guidance. The guidance introduces a five-step model to achieve its core principal of the entity recognizing revenue to depict
the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with
Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).” ASU 2016-08 provides specific guidance
to determine whether an entity is providing a specified good or service itself or is arranging for the good or service to be provided
by another party. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing.” ASU 2016-10 provides clarification on the subjects of identifying performance obligations and
licensing implementation guidance.</font></p>

requirements for these standards relating to Topic 606 will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017, which means the Company must adopt this standard effective October 1, 2018 for our fiscal year ending September 30,
2019. Management does not expect the new revenue recognition standard to materially impact the recognition of continuing royalty
fees from franchisees. They do, however, expect the adoption of Topic 606 to impact the accounting for initial franchise fees.
Currently, the Company recognizes revenue from initial franchise fees in a single, up-front transaction, upon the completion of
training of new franchisees, in the period in which all material obligations and initial services have been performed. Upon the
adoption of Topic 606, we believe the Company will need to recognize the revenue related to initial franchise fees over the term
of the related franchise agreement. This will result in less revenue in the short-term and more deferred revenue recognized over
a period of time. The company has not completed its analysis to estimate the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial
statements, but we are considering early adoption of this accounting standard utilizing the full retrospective approach during
our upcoming fiscal year. Management will continue to finalize these accounting policies, quantify the impact of adopting this
standard, and design and implement internal controls for this change during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018,</font></p>

transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
on the statement of cash flows. Under the new standard, income tax benefits and deficiencies are to be recognized as income tax
expense or benefit in the income statement and the tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items
in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity should also recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit
reduces taxes payable in the current period. Excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as
an operating activity. In regards to forfeitures, the entity may make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate
the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. This ASU is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period, however early adoption is permitted.
