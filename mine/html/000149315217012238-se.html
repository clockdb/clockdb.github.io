<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">RedHawk Holdings Corp.
(formerly Independence Energy Corp.) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 30, 2005 under the name “Oliver
Creek Resources Inc.” At inception, we were organized to acquire, explore and develop natural resource properties in the
United States. Effective August 12, 2008, we changed our name from “Oliver Creek Resources Inc.” to “Independence
Energy Corp.” and opened for trading on the Over-the Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol “IDNG.” Effective
October 13, 2015, by vote of a majority of the Company’s stockholders, the Company’s name was changed from “Independence
Energy Corp.” to “RedHawk Holdings Corp.”</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On March 31, 2014, the Company acquired the
exclusive right to distribute certain medical devices and changed the focus of its operations to include medical device distribution.
We have expanded our business focus to include other operations. Currently, we are a diversified holding company which, through
our subsidiaries, is engaged in sales and distribution of medical devices, sales of branded generic pharmaceutical drugs, commercial
real estate investment and leasing, sales of point of entry full-body security systems, and specialized financial services. Through
its medical products business unit, the Company sells WoundClot Surgical - Advanced Bleeding Control, the SANDD™ Insulin
Needle Destruction Unit (formerly known as the Disintegrator™), the Carotid Artery Digital Non-Contact Thermometer and Zonis®.
Through our United Kingdom based subsidiary, we manufacture, and market branded generic pharmaceuticals, certain other generic
pharmaceuticals known as “specials” and certain pharmaceuticals outside of the United Kingdom’s National Health
Service drug tariff referred to as NP8’s. The Company also holds the exclusive U.S. manufacturing and distribution rights
for the Centri Controlled Entry System, a unique, closed cabinet, nominal dose transmission full body x-ray scanner. Our real estate
leasing revenues are generated from a commercial property under a long-term lease. Additionally, the Company’s real estate
investment unit holds a limited liability company interest in a commercial restoration project in Hawaii.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><b>Going Concern</b></p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">These financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will not be able to continue as a going concern without
further financing. Currently, the Company must continue to realize its assets to discharge its liabilities in the normal course
of business. The Company has generated limited revenues to date and has never paid any dividends on its common stock and is unlikely
to pay any common stock dividends or generate significant earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">For the year ended June
30, 2017, the Company had a consolidated net loss of $407,681 on net revenues of $929,859 and used $154,640 of cash in operating
activities. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had cash of $53,939, working capital of $639,161 and an accumulated deficit of $3,243,543
including preferred stock dividends. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is still dependent upon the continued
financial support from its stockholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, cash proceeds from the sale of assets
and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company’s businesses in order to discharge its obligations. These factors
raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not
include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.</p><span></span>
