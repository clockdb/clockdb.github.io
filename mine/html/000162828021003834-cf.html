Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price to identifiable intangible assets is based on valuations performed to determine the fair values of such assets as of the acquisition dates. Generally, the Company engages a third-party independent valuation specialist to assist in management’s determination of fair values of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values of earn-out arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates.&nbsp;The Company estimates the fair value of contingent earn-out payments as part of the initial purchase price and records the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out payments are included in General and Administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Net Income and Comprehensive Income.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Several factors are considered when determining contingent consideration liabilities as part of the purchase price, including whether (i)&nbsp;the valuation of the acquisitions is not supported solely by the initial consideration paid, and the contingent earn-out formula is a critical and material component of the valuation approach to determining the purchase price; and (ii)&nbsp;the former owners of the acquired companies that remain as key employees receive compensation other than contingent earn-out payments at a reasonable level compared with the compensation of other key employees.&nbsp;The contingent earn-out payments are not affected by employment termination.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Company reviews and re-assesses the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities on a quarterly basis, and the updated fair value could differ from the initial estimates.&nbsp;The Company measures contingent consideration recognized in connection with business combinations at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 inputs. The Company uses a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach as a valuation technique to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities on the acquisition date and at each reporting period. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are projections over the earn-out period, and the probability outcome percentages that are assigned to each scenario. Significant increases or decreases to either of these inputs in isolation could result in a significantly higher or lower liability with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent consideration liabilities. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate on the acquisition date and amount paid will be recorded in earnings.

An entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. These qualitative factors include: macroeconomic and industry conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If the entity determines that this threshold is met, then the Company may apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company determines fair value through multiple valuation techniques, and weights the results accordingly.

Gross revenues from services transferred to customers over time accounted for 92%, 90%, and 92% of the Company’s revenues during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.    </span></div><div style="margin-top:10pt;text-indent:33.75pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Gross revenue from services transferred to customers at a point in time is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the reports and/or analysis performed. Gross revenue from services transferred to customers at a point in time accounted for 8%, 10%, and 8% of the Company’s revenues during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. </span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As of January&nbsp;2, 2021, the Company had $575,052 of remaining performance obligations, of which $489,009 is expected to be recognized over the next 12 months and the majority of the balance over the next 24 months. Contracts for which work authorizations have been received are included in performance obligations. Most of the Company's contracts are multi-year contracts for which funding is appropriated on an annual basis, therefore performance obligations include only those amounts that have been funded and authorized and does not reflect the full amounts the Company may receive over the term of such contracts. In the case of non-government contracts and project awards, performance obligations include future revenue at contract or customary rates, excluding contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of the client. For contracts with a not-to-exceed maximum amount, the Company includes revenue from such contracts in performance obligations to the extent of the remaining estimated amount.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Contract modifications are common in the performance of our contracts. Contracts modified typically result from changes in scope, specifications, design, performance, sites, or period of completion. In most cases, contract modifications are for services that are not distinct, and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events. These assumptions are dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates, including engineering progress, achievement of milestones, labor productivity and cost estimates. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates. If estimated total costs on contracts indicate a loss or reduction to the percentage of total contract revenues recognized to date, these losses or reductions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are known. The effect of revisions to revenues, estimated costs to complete contracts, including penalties, incentive awards, change orders, claims, anticipated losses and others are recorded on the cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions are identified and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects on the results of operations for that reporting period may be material depending on the size of the project or the adjustment. During fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 the cumulative catch-up adjustment for contract modifications was not material.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">A significant amount of the Company’s revenues are derived under multi-year contracts. The Company enters into contracts with its clients that contain two principal types of pricing provisions: cost-reimbursable and fixed-unit price. The majority of the Company’s contracts are cost-reimbursable contracts that fall under the low-risk subcategory of time and materials contracts.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Cost-reimbursable contracts</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> consist of the following:</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;padding-left:63pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">Time and materials contracts, which are common for smaller scale professional and technical consulting and certification services projects. Under these types of contracts, there is no predetermined fee. Instead, the Company negotiates hourly billing rates and charges the clients based upon actual hours expended on a project. In addition, any direct project expenditures are passed through to the client and are typically reimbursed. These contracts may have an initial not-to-exceed or guaranteed maximum price provision.</span></div><div style="margin-top:3pt;padding-left:63pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">Cost-plus contracts are the predominant contracting method used by U.S. federal, state, and local governments. Under these types of contracts, the Company charges clients for its costs, including both direct and indirect costs, plus a negotiated fee.

A valuation allowance against the Company’s deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future earnings, taxable income, and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Management periodically assesses the need for a valuation allowance based on the Company’s current and anticipated results of operations.&nbsp;The need for and the amount of a valuation allowance can change in the near term if operating results and projections change significantly.</span></div><div style="margin-top:12pt;text-indent:36pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Company recognizes the consolidated financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company applies the uncertain tax position guidance to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remains open. The Company’s policy is to classify interest and penalties as income tax expense.</span></div><span></span>
