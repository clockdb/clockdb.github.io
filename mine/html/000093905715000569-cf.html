The Company's determination of whether this investment is impaired is based on its assessment of the ultimate recoverability of cost rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value.  The determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability of cost is influenced by criteria such as (1) the significance of any decline in net assets of the FHLB as compared with the capital stock amount and the length of time any decline has persisted; (2) commitments by the FHLB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the FHLB; (3) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and, accordingly, the customer base of the FHLB; and (4) the liquidity position of the FHLB.  Based on its evaluation, the Company determined that there was no impairment of FHLB stock at September 30, 2015 and 2014.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Loans Held for Sale</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are stated in the aggregate at the lower of cost or estimated fair value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Net unrealized losses, if any, are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to income.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gains or losses on sales of loans are recognized at the time of sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;The gain or loss is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the recorded value of the loans, including any remaining unamortized deferred loan origination fees.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Loans Receivable</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by the undisbursed portion of construction loans in process, deferred loan origination fees and the allowance for loan losses.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Impaired Loans</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">A loan is generally considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest payments due in accordance with the original or modified terms of the loan agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a loan is considered collateral dependent, impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less any prior liens, and when applicable, less estimated selling costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;For impaired loans that are not collateral dependent, impairment is measured using the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The categories of non-accrual loans and impaired loans overlap, although they are not identical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Troubled Debt Restructured Loans</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">A troubled debt restructured loan is a loan for which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a significant concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider.  Examples of such concessions include, but are not limited to: a reduction in the stated interest rate; an extension of the maturity at an interest rate below current market rates; a reduction in the face amount of the debt; a reduction in the accrued interest; or re-amortizations, extensions, deferrals and renewals. Troubled debt restructured loans are considered impaired and are individually evaluated for impairment.

Qualitative factors are determined by loan type and allow management to adjust reserve levels to reflect the current general economic environment and portfolio performance trends including recent charge-off trends.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowances are provided based on management’s continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio, including changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, current economic conditions, collateral values, geographic concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, specific industry conditions, the duration of the current business cycle, and regulatory requirements and expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is estimated based upon these factors and trends identified by management at the time consolidated financial statements are prepared.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In accordance with GAAP, a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts (principal and interest) due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, may be collectively evaluated for impairment. When a loan has been identified as being impaired, the amount of the impairment is measured by using discounted cash flows, except when, as an alternative, the current estimated fair value of the collateral, reduced by estimated costs to sell (if applicable), or observable market price is used. The valuation of real estate collateral is subjective in nature and may be adjusted in future periods because of changes in economic conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management considers third-party appraisals, as well as independent fair market value assessments from realtors or persons involved in selling real estate, in determining the estimated fair value of particular properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as certain of these third-party appraisals and independent fair market value assessments are only updated periodically, changes in the values of specific properties may have occurred subsequent to the most recent appraisals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the amounts of any such potential changes and any related adjustments are generally recorded at the time such information is received. When the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (including accrued interest and net deferred loan origination fees or costs), impairment is recognized by creating or adjusting an allocation of the allowance for loan losses and uncollected accrued interest is reversed against interest income. If ultimate collection of principal is in doubt, all cash receipts on impaired loans are applied to reduce the principal balance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">A provision for (recapture of) loan losses is charged (credited) to operations and is added to (deducted from) the allowance for loan losses based on a quarterly comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio.

The projection uses management's estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in loans and deposits, estimates of future expected changes in net interest margins and cash expenditures.  Key assumptions used by the Company in its discounted cash flow model (income approach) included an annual loan growth rate that ranged from </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">3.00%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> to </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">3.60%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, an annual deposit growth rate that ranged from </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">2.20%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> to </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">3.20%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and a return on assets that ranged from </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">0.80%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> to </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">1.00%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  In addition to the above projections of estimated operating results, key assumptions used to determine the fair value estimate under the approach were the discount rate of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">12.2%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and the residual capitalization rate of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">9.2%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  The discount rate used was the cost of equity capital.  The cost of equity capital was based on the capital asset pricing model ("CAPM"), modified to account for a small stock premium.  The small stock premium represents the additional return required by investors for small stocks based on the</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;"> 2015 Valuation Handbook - Guide to Cost of Capital. </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> Beyond the approximate five-year forecast period, residual free cash flows were estimated to increase at a constant rate into perpetuity.  These cash flows were converted to a residual value using an appropriate residual capitalization rate.  The residual capitalization rate was equal to the discount rate minus the expected long-term growth rate of cash flows.  Based on historical results, the economic climate, the outlook for the industry and management's expectations, a long-term growth rate of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">3.0%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> was estimated.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The public company market approach analysis estimates the fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit's operating performance.  The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to those of the Company.  Key assumptions used by the Company included the selection of comparable public companies and performance ratios.  In applying the public company analysis, the Company selected nine publicly traded institutions based on similar lines of business, markets, growth prospects, risks and firm size.  The performance ratios included price to earnings (last twelve months), price to earnings (current year to date), price to book value, price to tangible book value and price to deposits.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The merger and acquisition market approach analysis estimates the fair value by using merger and acquisition transactions involving companies that are similar in nature to the Company.  Key assumptions used by the Company included the selection of comparable merger and acquisition transactions and valuation ratios to be used.  The analysis used banks located in Washington or Oregon that were acquired after January 1, 2013.  The valuation ratios from these transactions for price to earnings and price to tangible book value were then used to derive an estimated fair value of the Company.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The trading price market approach analysis used the closing market price at May 29, 2015 of the Company's common stock, traded on the NASDAQ Global Market to determine the market value of total equity capital.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">A key assumption used by the Company in the public company market approach analysis and the trading price market approach analysis was the application of a control premium.  The Company's common stock is thinly traded, and therefore management believes the trading price reflects a discount for illiquidity.  In addition, the trading price of the Company's common stock reflects a minority interest value.  To determine the fair market value of a majority interest in the Company's stock, premiums were calculated and applied to the indicated values.  Therefore, a control premium was applied to the results of the discounted cash flow income approach analysis, the public company market approach analysis and the trading price market approach analysis because the initial value conclusion was based on minority interest transactions.  Merger and acquisition studies were analyzed to conclude that the difference between the acquisition price and a company's stock price prior to acquisition indicates, in part, the price effect of a controlling interest.  Based on the evaluation of merger and acquisition studies, a control premium of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">25%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> was used.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of goodwill impairment has occurred.  Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in the expected future cash flows; a sustained significant decline in the Company's stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; adverse assessment or action by a regulator; and unanticipated competition.  Key assumptions used in the annual goodwill impairment test are highly judgmental and include: selection of comparable companies, amount of control premium, projected cash flows and discount rate applied to projected cash flows.  Any change in these indicators or key assumptions could have a significant negative impact on the Company's financial condition, impact the goodwill impairment analysis or cause the Company to perform a goodwill impairment analysis more frequently than once per year.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">As of September 30, 2015, management believes that there had been no events or changes in the circumstances since May 31, 2015 that would indicate a potential impairment of goodwill.

MSRs are capitalized at estimated fair value when acquired through the origination of loans that are subsequently sold with the servicing rights retained and are amortized to servicing income on loans sold approximately in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income.&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of MSRs at the date of the sale of loans is estimated based on the discounted present value of expected future cash flows using key assumptions for servicing income and costs and expected prepayment rates on the underlying loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated fair value is periodically evaluated for impairment by comparing actual cash flows and estimated future cash flows from the servicing assets to those estimated at the time the servicing assets were originated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair values are estimated using expected future discounted cash flows based on current market rates of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of measuring impairment, the MSRs must be stratified by one or more predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company stratifies its capitalized MSRs based on product type and term of the underlying loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of impairment recognized is the amount, if any, by which the amortized cost of the MSRs exceeds their fair value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Impairment, if deemed temporary, is recognized through a valuation allowance

the&nbsp;ESOP in the consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;The debt of the ESOP is payable to Timberland Bancorp and is therefore eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;As shares are released from collateral, compensation expense is recorded equal to the average market price of the shares for the period, and the shares become available for net income per common share calculations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividends paid on unallocated shares reduce the Company’s cash contributions to the ESOP.</font></div><div

The core principle of this ASU is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  In general, the new guidance requires companies to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract and estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price related to each separate performance obligation.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, which deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-14, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  The ASU addresses the classification of foreclosed loans that are either fully or partially guaranteed under government programs.  ASU No. 2014-14 clarifies that upon foreclosure of fully or partially guaranteed loans which are guaranteed under government programs and meet certain conditions, the creditor will be required to reclassify the previously existing mortgage loan to a separate other receivable from the guarantor, measured at the amount of the loan balance (principal and interest) that it expects to collect from the guarantor.  ASU No. 2014-14 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014 for public organizations.  The adoption of ASU No. 2014-14 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  The ASU eliminates the need to separately classify, present and disclose extraordinary events.  The disclosure of events or transactions that are unusual or infrequent in nature will be included in other guidance.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of ASU No. 2015-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  The ASU is intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures (collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed security transactions).  The ASU focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  In addition to reducing the number of consolidation models from four to two, the new standard simplifies the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("Codification") and improves current GAAP by placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest.  ASU No. 2015-02 will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015 for public companies.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The adoption of ASU No. 2015-02 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In June 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-10, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Technical Corrections and Improvements</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  On November 10, 2010, the FASB added a standing project that will facilitate the Codification updates for technical corrections, clarifications and improvements.  These amendments are referred to as Technical Corrections and Improvements.  Maintenance updates include non-substantive corrections to the Codification, such as editorial corrections, various link-related changes and changes to source fragment information.  This update contains amendments that will affect a wide variety of Topics in the Codification.  The amendments in this ASU will apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance and generally fall into one of four categories: amendments related to differences between original guidance and the Codification, guidance clarification and reference corrections, simplification and minor improvements.  In summary, the amendments in this ASU represent changes to clarify the Codification, correct unintended application of guidance or make minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice.  Transaction guidance varies based on the amendments in this ASU.  The amendments in this ASU that require transition guidance are effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within these fiscal years, beginning  after December 15, 2015.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  All other amendments were effective upon the issuance of this ASU.  The adoption of ASU 2015-10 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">  This ASU requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in the current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  ASU No. 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The adoption of ASU No. 2015-16 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.</font></div></div><span></span>
