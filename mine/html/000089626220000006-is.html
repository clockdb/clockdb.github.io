Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset ("ROU asset") for all leases with a term greater than twelve months and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Additionally, leases will be classified as either financing or operating; the classification will determine the pattern of expense recognition and classification within the statement of operations. We are using the standards' effective date as our date of initial application. Consequently, our financial information was not updated and the disclosures required under the new standard are not provided for dates and periods prior to January 1, 2019. The new standard provides several optional practical expedients that can be adopted at transition. We have elected the "package of practical expedients," which allows us to not reassess our prior conclusions regarding lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We did not elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to us. The most significant effects related to this adoption relate to (1) the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our real estate and fleet operating leases; and (2) significant new disclosures about our leasing activities. Upon adoption, we recognized approximately </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>$80 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> in operating leases liabilities with corresponding ROU assets of approximately the same amount. The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. We have elected the practical expedient that allows us to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases. We are applying the short-term lease recognition exemption to certain information technology leases; therefore, we have not recognized ROU assets and lease liabilities for these leases.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07,</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;"> Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployees Share-Based Payment Accounting </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payments issued to nonemployees for goods or services. Our adoption of this standard on January 1, 2019 did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">and ASU 2015-14, </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> (collectively, "ASC 606"), the new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") on revenue recognition, using the full retrospective method. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The standards supersede existing revenue recognition requirements and eliminate most industry-specific guidance from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP"). The core principle of the revenue recognition standard is to require an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. As a result of the Company's adoption of ASC 606, the revenue and related estimated uncollectible amounts owed to us by non-Medicare payors that were historically classified as provision for doubtful accounts are now considered a revenue adjustment in determining net service revenue. Accordingly, the Company reports estimated uncollectible balances due from third-party payors and uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction of the transaction price and therefore, as a reduction in net service revenue (or as it relates to Hospice room and board, an increase in cost of service, excluding depreciation and amortization) when historically these amounts were classified as provision for doubtful accounts within operating expenses within our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the adoption of ASC 606 resulted in increased disclosure, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, which provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as an acquisition (or disposal) of assets or a business. We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018, on a prospective basis. The impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures will depend on the facts and circumstances of any specific future transactions as evaluated under the new framework.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge (Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test). Instead, impairment will be measured using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018, on a prospective basis and will apply this guidance to our future tests of goodwill impairment.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, which provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues not specifically addressed by U.S. GAAP. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017. The standard should be applied using a retrospective transition method unless it is impractical to do so for some of the issues. In such case, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Our adoption of this standard on January 1, 2018, using a retrospective transition method for each period presented, did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvement to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, which simplified the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liability and classification within the statement of cash flows. The ASU was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016.  We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2017, and as a result, we recorded a </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>$0.4 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> increase to our non-current deferred tax asset and retained earnings for tax benefits that were not previously recognized under the prior rules. Additionally, on a prospective basis, we recorded excess tax benefits totaling </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>$3.2 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> as a discrete item in our income tax provision within our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Historically, these amounts were recorded as additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheet. We also elected to prospectively apply the change to the presentation of cash payments made to taxing authorities on the employees' behalf for shares withheld upon stock vesting within our consolidated statement of cash flows and to continue our current policy of estimating forfeitures of stock-based compensation awards at grant date and revising in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and improves consistent application by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. While the Company does not expect a material impact upon adoption of ASU 2019-12, we are still evaluating the effect the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and ongoing financial reporting.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Use of Estimates</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. GAAP. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in our accompanying consolidated financial statements, and business combinations accounted for as purchases have been included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.

Third party equity interests in our consolidated joint ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements. During 2016, we sold a </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>30%</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> interest in one of our care centers while maintaining a controlling interest in the newly formed joint venture; we repurchased the </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>30%</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> interest during 2018.</span></div><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We account for investments in entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>50%</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a variable interest entity in which we are the primary beneficiary. During 2018, we made a </span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><span>$7.0 million</span></span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> investment in a healthcare analytics company; this investment is accounted for under the equity method.
