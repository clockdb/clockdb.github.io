<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><u>Organization and Nature of Business</u></p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">mPhase Technologies, Inc., including its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as “mPhase,” “XDSL,” “Company,” “us,”
or “we.”</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">We were incorporated in the state of New Jersey
during 1979 under the name Tecma Laboratory, Inc. During 1987, we changed our name to Tecma Laboratories, Inc. As Tecma Laboratories,
Inc., we were primarily engaged in the research, development and exploration of products in the skin care field. On February 17,
1997, we acquired Lightpaths, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was engaged in the development of telecommunications products
incorporating DSL technology, and we changed our name to Lightpaths TP Technologies, Inc.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On May 5, 1997, we completed a reverse merger
with Lightpaths TP Technologies, Inc. and thereafter changed our name to mPhase Technologies, Inc. on June 2, 1997.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">From inception through June 30, 2010, we focused
much of our efforts in the commercial deployment of our TV+ products for delivery of broadcast IPTV, and DSL component products
which include POTS splitters. Beginning in 2004, we added a new line of power cell batteries and electronic sensors (magnetometers)
being developed through the use of nano-technology. As of June 30, 2010, we discontinued our TV+ line of products as well as our
electronic sensor products.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Beginning June 30, 2010, we shifted our primary
business focus to the development of innovative power cells and related products through the science of microfluidics, microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS) and nano-technology. Using these disciplines, we developed a battery that has a significantly longer shelf life
prior to activation than conventional batteries. In addition, such battery product, unlike conventional batteries, is capable of
disposal after use without harm to the environment. Presently, we are pursuing strategic alternatives to best monetize our patent
portfolio, including partnering to exploit opportunities for our drug delivery system. We are seeking to obtain government funding
available under the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security including The Department of Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium
(“DOTC”), Small Business Innovative Research (“SBIR”), Cooperative Research and Development Agreements
(“CRADA”) and similar programs for targeted applications for our smart nano-battery applications.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;On January 11, 2019, we underwent a major
change in management and control. New management is positioning us to be a technology leader in artificial intelligence and machine
learning while enabling a more rapid commercial development of our patent portfolio and other intellectual property. We believe
there are significant opportunities to embed artificial intelligence and machine learning into business operations, platform architectures,
business services, and customer experiences, whereby our goal is to generate significant revenue from our artificial intelligence
and machine learning technologies.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On February 15, 2019, we acquired Travel Buddhi,
a software platform to enhance travel via ultra-customization tools that tailor a planned trip experience in ways not previously
available.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On June 30, 2019, we acquired 99% of the outstanding
common shares of Alpha Predictions LLP (“Alpha Predictions”). Alpha Predictions is an India-based technology company
that has developed a suite of commercial data analysis products for use across multiple industries. This acquisition has been integrated
into our international operations and as expected, has driven revenue growth and innovation.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On May 11, 2020, we acquired CloseComms, a
patented, software application platform that can be integrated into a retail customer’s existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, giving
the retailer important customer data and enabling AI-enhanced, targeted promotions to drive store traffic and sales.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><u>Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic</u></p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">A novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, surfaced
during December 2019 and has spread around the world, including to the United States. During March 2020, COVID-19 was declared
a pandemic by the World Health Organization. During certain periods of the pandemic thus far, a number of U.S. states and various
countries throughout the world had been under governmental orders requiring that all workers remain at home unless their work was
critical, essential, or life-sustaining. As a result of these governmental orders, the Company temporarily closed its domestic
and international offices and required all of its employees to work remotely. Although these temporary office closures created
minor disruption to the Company’s business operations, such disruptions to date have not been significant.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
the Company’s financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, such as the ultimate duration
and scope of the pandemic, its impact on the Company’s employees, customers, and vendors, in addition to how quickly normal
economic conditions and operations resume and whether the pandemic impacts other risks disclosed in Item 1A “Risk Factors”
within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Even after the pandemic has subsided, the Company may continue to experience adverse impacts
to its business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred as a result of the pandemic. Therefore,
the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact at this time. The Company continues to actively monitor the pandemic and may
determine to take further actions that alter its business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities
or that it determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers, vendors, and shareholders.</p><span></span>
