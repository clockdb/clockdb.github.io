Management has determined that the Company operates in </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">one</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> segment: the development of pharmaceutical products on its own behalf or in collaboration with others. All long-lived assets of the Company reside in the United States.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management used estimates in the following areas, among others: revenue recognition for multiple-element revenue arrangements; stock-based compensation expense; accrued expenses; and the evaluation of the existence of conditions and events that raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments maturing within </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">90 days</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> from the date of purchase. Investments consist of securities with original maturities greater than 90 days when purchased. The Company classifies these investments as available-for-sale and records them at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Premiums or discounts from par value are amortized to investment income over the life of the underlying investment.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Although available to be sold to meet operating needs or otherwise, securities are generally held through maturity.

The Company has not experienced any credit losses in these accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds. The Company has no foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other foreign exchange hedging arrangements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">At December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, substantially all of the Company’s cash was deposited in accounts at </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">two</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> financial institutions, thus limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. These amounts at times may exceed federally insured limits.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Accounts receivable generally represent amounts due from collaboration partners.

Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, whereas major improvements are capitalized as additions to property and equipment. Potential impairment is assessed when there is evidence that events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. No such impairment losses have been recorded through December&nbsp;31, 2016.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Rent Expense</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company’s operating lease for its Lexington, Massachusetts facility provides for scheduled annual rent increases throughout the lease term.

Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12&nbsp;months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, current portion. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company’s revenue is currently generated through collaborative research and development and licensing agreements. The terms of these agreements typically contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to product candidates, referred to as exclusive licenses, as well as research and development activities to be performed by the Company on behalf of the collaboration partner related to the licensed product candidates. The terms of these agreements may include payments to the Company of one or more of the following: a nonrefundable, upfront payment; milestone payments; payment of license exercise or option fees with respect to product candidates; fees for research and development services rendered; and royalties on commercial sales of licensed product candidates, if any. To date, the Company has received upfront payments, several milestone payments and certain research and development service payments but has not received any license exercise or option fees or earned royalty revenue as a result of product sales.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">When evaluating multiple element arrangements, the Company considers whether the deliverables under the arrangement represent separate units of accounting. This evaluation requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. In determining the units of accounting, management evaluates certain criteria, including whether the deliverables have standalone value, based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company determines the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the BESP for a deliverable requires significant judgment. The Company has used its BESP to estimate the selling price for licenses to the Company’s proprietary technology, since the Company does not have&nbsp;VSOE or TPE of selling price for these deliverables. In those circumstances where the Company utilizes BESP to determine the estimated selling price of a license to the Company’s proprietary technology, the Company considers market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreement, estimated development costs, and the probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating the Company’s BESP, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple deliverables.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company’s multiple-element revenue arrangements may include the following:</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Exclusive Licenses</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. The deliverables under the Company’s collaboration agreements generally include exclusive licenses to develop, manufacture and commercialize one or more deuterated compounds. To account for this element of the arrangement, management evaluates whether the exclusive license has standalone value from the undelivered elements based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances of each arrangement, including the research and development capabilities of the collaboration partner. The Company may recognize the arrangement consideration allocated to licenses upon delivery of the license if facts and circumstances indicate that the license has standalone value from the undelivered elements, which generally include research and development services. The Company defers arrangement consideration allocated to licenses if facts and circumstances indicate that the delivered license does not have standalone value from the undelivered elements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">When management believes the license does not have stand-alone value from the other deliverables to be provided in the arrangement, the Company generally recognizes revenue attributed to the license on a straight-line basis over the Company’s contractual or estimated performance period, which is typically the term of the Company’s research and development obligations. If management cannot reasonably estimate when the Company’s performance obligation ends, then revenue is deferred until management can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ends. The periods over which revenue should be recognized are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement. Such a change could have a&nbsp;material impact on the amount of revenue the Company records in future periods.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Research and Development Services</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. The deliverables under the Company’s collaboration and license agreements may include deliverables related to research and development services to be performed by the Company on behalf of the collaboration partner.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Payments or reimbursements resulting from the Company’s research and development efforts are recognized as the services are performed and presented on a gross basis because the Company is the principal for such efforts, so long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection of the&nbsp;related amount is reasonably assured. If there is no discernible pattern of performance and/or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the period it is expected to complete its performance obligations. Conversely, if the pattern of performance in which the service is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then the Company recognizes revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned as of the period end date.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Option Agreements</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. The Company’s arrangements may provide a collaborator with the right to select a deuterated compound for licensing within an initial pre-defined selection period. Under these agreements, a fee&nbsp;would be due to the Company upon the exercise of an option to acquire a license. The accounting for option arrangements is dependent on the nature of the option granted to the collaboration partner. An option is considered substantive if, at the inception of the arrangement, the Company is at risk as to whether the collaboration partner will choose to exercise the option to secure exclusive licenses. Factors that the Company considers in evaluating whether an option is substantive include the overall objective of the arrangement, the benefit the collaborator might obtain from the arrangement without exercising the option, the cost to exercise the option relative to the total upfront consideration and the additional financial commitments or economic penalties imposed on the collaborator as a result of exercising the option. For arrangements under which an option to secure a license is considered substantive, the Company does not consider the license underlying the option to be&nbsp;a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement. For arrangements under which the option to secure a license is not considered substantive, the Company considers the license underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and, upon delivery of the license, would apply the multiple-element revenue arrangement criteria to the license and any other deliverables to determine the appropriate revenue recognition. A&nbsp;significant and incremental discount included in an otherwise substantive option is considered to be a separate deliverable at the inception of the arrangement.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Milestone Revenue</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. The Company’s collaboration agreements generally include contingent milestone payments related to specified development milestones, regulatory milestones and sales-based milestones. Development milestones are typically payable when a product candidate initiates or advances in clinical trial phases or achieves defined clinical events such as proof-of-concept. Regulatory milestones are typically payable upon submission for marketing approval with regulatory authorities or upon receipt of actual marketing approvals for a&nbsp;compound, approvals for additional indications, upon commercial launch or upon the first commercial sale. Sales-based milestones are typically payable when annual sales reach specified levels.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either (i)&nbsp;the entity’s performance to achieve the milestone or (ii)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity’s performance to achieve the milestone; (b)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance; and (c)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment. Milestones that are not considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of performance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Research and Development Costs</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in providing research and development activities, including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead costs, contract research and development services, and other outside costs. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">External research and development expenses associated with the Company’s programs include clinical trial site costs, research compounds and clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants and other outside services, such as data management and statistical analysis support, and materials and supplies used in support of the clinical and nonclinical programs. Internal costs of the Company’s clinical program include salaries, benefits, stock based compensation, and an allocation of the Company’s facility costs. When third-party service providers’ billing terms do not coincide with the Company’s period-end, the Company is required to make estimates of its obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs and costs for supply of its drug candidates, incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. The Company bases its estimates on its knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company issues stock options to certain employees, officers and directors. The Company accounts for stock compensation using the fair value method, which results in the recognition of compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards. See Note 9 for additional information.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Prior to the Company’s IPO, the estimated fair value of its common stock on each stock option grant date was determined by the Company’s board of directors based on contemporaneous and retrospective valuation estimates provided by management and prepared in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Technical Practice Aid,&nbsp;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, as well as independent third-party valuations. The Company’s valuations of its common stock were based on a number of objective and subjective factors, including external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry sector and the prices at which it sold shares of preferred stock, the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to its common stock at the time of each grant and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an IPO. Following the Company’s IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying stock options has been the closing price on the option grant date.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Income Taxes</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company provides deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the Company’s financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company evaluates tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in the course of preparing its tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “more likely than not” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recognized as a tax expense.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Guarantees</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">As permitted under Delaware law, the Company indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at the Company’s request in such capacity. The term of&nbsp;the indemnification is for the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments the&nbsp;Company could be required to make is unlimited; however, the Company has directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage that limits its exposure and enables it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company leases office space under a non-cancelable operating lease which is further described in Note&nbsp;12, Commitments. The Company has a standard indemnification arrangement under the lease that requires it to indemnify the landlord against all costs, expenses, fines, suits, claims, demands, liabilities, and actions directly resulting from any breach, violation, or non-performance of any covenant or condition of the Company’s lease.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had not experienced any material losses related to these indemnification obligations, and no material claims with respect thereto were outstanding. The Company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and, consequently, concluded that&nbsp;the fair value of these obligations is negligible, and no related reserves were established.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Comprehensive (Loss) Income</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Comprehensive (loss) income is comprised of net (loss) income and other comprehensive income or loss. Other comprehensive income or loss consists of unrealized gains and losses on investments.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Pending and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No.&nbsp;2014-09,&nbsp;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), or ASU 2014-09, which stipulates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, ASU 2014-09 provides that an entity should apply the following steps: (1)&nbsp;identify the contract(s) with a customer, (2)&nbsp;identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3)&nbsp;determine the transaction price, (4)&nbsp;allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5)&nbsp;recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This update will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of the FASB’s one year deferral of the effective date for this standard. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period (full retrospective) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application (modified retrospective). The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 and apply the full retrospective approach.&nbsp;The Company is currently evaluating the effect of adopting the requirements of ASU 2014-09 as it relates to the accounting for its collaboration arrangements with Celgene, Jazz and Avanir, and its patent assignment agreement with Auspex.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15,&nbsp;Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, or ASU 2014-15. ASU 2014-15 amends FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern, by providing guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements, including requiring management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity’s financial statements and providing certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is required to apply the requirements of ASU 2014-15 in its annual financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2016 and for interim financial statements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. With respect to the 2016 annual financial statements, the Company did not identify any conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,&nbsp;Leases (Topic 842), or ASU 2016-02. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 also will require certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial statements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,&nbsp;Compensation-Stock Compensation-Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, or ASU 2016-09. This update simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements as well as classification of related amounts on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company has evaluated this ASU and does not expect it to have a material effect on its financial statements and related disclosures. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br clear="none"></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)-Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, or ASU 2016-13. The new standard requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASU 2016-13 will become effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-13 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.</font></div></div><span></span>
